> Our Reseachers Believe Danny Rothschild Substituted Erika Two For Erika One At Ft. Huachuca

our researchers believe "they" substituted George Webb for some "controlled opposition doppleganger" who is now posting beautiful spam (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beautifulspam) to keep idiots entertained and distracted from the elephants in the room, mostly distracted from global depopulation / famine / collapse (see also: Michael Yon).

i mean, why should "they" allow George Webb to "talk shit" about their conspiracies / secret operations? why should "they" not apply their power / playbook / rules on George Webb? is George Webb some "untouchable superhuman" with "diplomatic immunity"?

is "George Webb" a scammer? i want my money back! (7 EUR for the monthly substack subscription) (only scammers must hide behind paywalls)

"Yes, paywalls stop the direct connect to the article. Not my policy this is the policy of these mainstream media publishers"

bullshit. you have full control over your blog. you can decide whether your posts are paywalled or not.



just answer my questions:

- why are all of your sources offline in your recent posts since about 2025-12-10?

- why is your blog paywalled since about 2025-12-10?

- why are your posts flooded with positive comments ("George Webb will save us") despite your posts are trash since about 2025-12-10?

your censorship of my other comment ("User was temporarily suspended for this comment.") ("Comment removed")
only confirms my suspicion that you now are "George Webb Two", and the original George Webb is either in prison or dead.
