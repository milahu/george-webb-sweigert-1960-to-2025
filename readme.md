> Our Reseachers Believe Danny Rothschild Substituted Erika Two For Erika One At Ft. Huachuca

our researchers believe "they" substituted George Webb for some "controlled opposition doppleganger" who is now posting beautiful spam (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beautifulspam) to keep idiots entertained and distracted from the elephants in the room, mostly distracted from global depopulation / famine / collapse (see also: Michael Yon).

i mean, why should "they" allow George Webb to "talk shit" about their conspiracies / secret operations? why should "they" not apply their power / playbook / rules on George Webb? is George Webb some "untouchable superhuman" with "diplomatic immunity"?

is "George Webb" a scammer? i want my money back! (7 EUR for the monthly substack subscription) (only scammers must hide behind paywalls)

Only one of the links worked. If you directly google the NYT “coercion” article the only return you get is G Webb’s Substack. It could be an AI hallucination, but if so that’s just sloppiness on his part not to check the links. 

What’s interesting is that his “layers” premise is so plausible. Also CO’s SF source sounded so fake I couldn’t finish listening to the interview. 

Like my uncle used to say, “Who da hell knowz” anymore. One assertion CO makes that is 100%, probably true: Everything is fake and gay.

no, zero links work. 100% fail rate.

just?! real science tolerates zero slop / leftism / tricks / lies.

> his “layers” premise is so plausible

all the “informed speculations” by “George Webb” are plausible, but the presentation of these speculations in his recent blog posts (no sources, emotional images) is “shady” at best…

to me these are red flags of a scammer. this does not look like content from someone who truly wants to “expose corruption for the greater good”.

maybe George Webb was legit when he started (i dont know his older work), but to me this looks like George Webb was replaced with “George Webb Two”.

> Everything is fake and gay.

no, only 99% is fake. 99% cover noise and 1% hidden signals.

but everything that becomes “too famous” becomes infiltrated / subverted / corrupted by the elite, hence “trust no celebrities” (german: “trau keinem promi”)

to compare, some people i trust:

Michael Yon - https://substack.com/@michaelyon

Mike Adams - https://www.brighteon.com/

Christian Westbrook = Ice Age Farmer - https://unshadowed.substack.com/p/what-happened-to-ice-age-farmer

these people have the balls to talk about the elephants in the room: global depopulation, global famine, global destruction of food supply, …
