# George Webb is a scammer. Since when?

2025-12-26T11:28:53+00:00 milahu2

update: "Sorry, this post was removed by Reddit’s filters."

<blockquote>

all the “informed speculations” by “George Webb” are plausible, but the presentation of these speculations in his recent blog posts (no sources, emotional images) is “shady” at best…

to me, these are red flags of a scammer. this does not look like content from someone who truly wants to “expose corruption for the greater good”.

maybe George Webb was legit when he started (i dont know his older work), but to me this looks like George Webb was replaced with “George Webb Two” (controlled opposition), who is now posting [beautiful spam](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beautifulspam) to keep idiots entertained and distracted from the elephants in the room: global depopulation / famine / collapse

it would be interesting to find the exact point in time when George Webb turned from "truther" to "controlled opposition".

## trust no celebrities

everything that becomes “too famous” becomes infiltrated / subverted / corrupted by the elite, hence “trust no celebrities” (german: “trau keinem promi”)

to compare, some people i trust:

- Michael Yon - https://substack.com/@michaelyon
- Mike Adams - https://www.brighteon.com/
- Christian Westbrook = Ice Age Farmer - https://unshadowed.substack.com/p/what-happened-to-ice-age-farmer
- Tilman Knechtel = TrauKeinemPromi - https://odysee.com/@traukeinempromi:9 - https://www.metanoia-magazin.com/
- [Wolfgang Eggert - missing since summer 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1prb1f9/wolfgang_eggert_1962_german_conspiracy_theorist/)

these people have the balls to talk about the elephants in the room: global depopulation, global famine, global destruction of food supply, …

## red flags

- [his blog](https://archive.is/georgewebb.substack.com) is hidden behind a paywall since about 2025-12-10.
- [his recent blog post](http://archive.is/https://georgewebb.substack.com/p/which-was-it-erika-one-or-erika-two) is AI slop / AI hallucinations. all sources are offline. the post is filled with emotional images.
- almost all comments are positive ("George Webb will save us"), despite the posts are [trash](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=beautifulspam).

## all sources are offline

my comment to [his recent blog post](http://archive.is/https://georgewebb.substack.com/p/which-was-it-erika-one-or-erika-two):

## who is George Webb?

[Who is George Webb - factually.co](https://factually.co/fact-checks/media/who-is-george-webb-notable-investigations-91e52b)

> George Webb (full name George Webb Sweigert in public records) is a self-styled, independent investigator and online journalist who has used crowd-sourcing and public-records requests to pursue stories; he has filed at least 18 public-records requests via MuckRock and appears in multiple MuckRock entries [1] [2]. His work is best known online for long-running, sometimes partisan investigations circulated via YouTube and other platforms, and for mobilizing amateur researchers in what some supporters call large “crowd-sourced” investigations [3].

> 6. Limitations in available reporting and what is not found
>
> The provided sources are limited: MuckRock supplies documentation of his public-records activity but not comprehensive biographical background [2] [1]. The Medium profile is enthusiastic and frames Webb as leading large crowd-sourced probes, but independent verification, corroboration from legacy outlets, or detailed adjudication of specific claims are not present in these sources [3]. Available sources do not mention systematic fact-checks, corrections, or disputes about his major allegations (available sources do not mention those).

[George Webb - caravantomidnight.com](https://caravantomidnight.com/george-webb/)

> A career techie who happened to stumble across a drug operation run by local law enforcement about ten years ago, Webb attempted to report what he knew to the proper authorities, as any conscientious member of a community would. However, the unsuspecting Webb discovered that by doing so he became the target of systematic low-grade harassment and intimidation. A few years later when the FBI began setting up Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF) across the country under the auspices of current Deputy Attorney General Andrew McCabe, Webb’s hometown became a nexus of controversy when it initially refused the agency. Months of protest ensued and a young Somalian man was named as the mastermind behind a bomb plot. The circumstances, however, seemed to unveil an unsuccessful jihadist recruitment psy-op by U.S. ‘Intel,’ based on historical evidence of such activity reported by journalists and retired law enforcement officers, such as the late FBI Director Ted Gunderson. This pattern also lined up directly with Webb’s now-personal experience. In a final turn of events, Ed Snowden’s groundbreaking leak of National Security Agency (NSA) documents drew Webb’s attention, but also an escalation of harassment for speaking out in support of Snowden. It was at this point in 2013 that Webb decided to commit himself full time to exposing corruption.
>
> Webb’s current investigation began with the July 2016 Wikileaks release of John Podesta’s emails in which former Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman is fingered as the whistleblower and of whom, Podesta remarks in one of his emails that he was ‘definitely for making an example of the suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it.’ Knowing the scenario Braverman was likely to face as the source for a leak of such enormous consequence, Webb began digging deeper online into the former foundation CEO’s story. Over the coming months, Webb began piecing together a vast global network of elected and appointed officials, Federal, State and local law enforcement, and powerful corporate interests that collude to strip nations of their resources exploiting taxpayer funds to do so. His research details a strategy and action plan used by this network to destabilize then undermine governments to serve the interests of those who profit most from ongoing war and devastation.
