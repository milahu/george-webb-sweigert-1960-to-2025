His work is best known online for long-running, sometimes partisan investigations circulated via YouTube and other platforms, and for mobilizing amateur researchers in what some supporters call large \u201ccrowd-sourced\u201d investigations [3].\n\n&gt; 6. Limitations in available reporting and what is not found\n&gt;\n&gt; The provided sources are limited: MuckRock supplies documentation of his public-records activity but not comprehensive biographical background [2] [1]. The Medium profile is enthusiastic and frames Webb as leading large crowd-sourced probes, but independent verification, corroboration from legacy outlets, or detailed adjudication of specific claims are not present in these sources [3]. Available sources do not mention systematic fact-checks, corrections, or disputes about his major allegations (available sources do not mention those).\n\n[George Webb - caravantomidnight.com](https://caravantomidnight.com/george-webb/)\n\n&gt; A career techie who happened to stumble across a drug operation run by local law enforcement about ten years ago, Webb attempted to report what he knew to the proper authorities, as any conscientious member of a community would. However, the unsuspecting Webb discovered that by doing so he became the target of systematic low-grade harassment and intimidation. A few years later when the FBI began setting up Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF) across the country under the auspices of current Deputy Attorney General Andrew McCabe, Webb\u2019s hometown became a nexus of controversy when it initially refused the agency. Months of protest ensued and a young Somalian man was named as the mastermind behind a bomb plot. The circumstances, however, seemed to unveil an unsuccessful jihadist recruitment psy-op by U.S. \u2018Intel,\u2019 based on historical evidence of such activity reported by journalists and retired law enforcement officers, such as the late FBI Director Ted Gunderson. This pattern also lined up directly with Webb\u2019s now-personal experience. In a final turn of events, Ed Snowden\u2019s groundbreaking leak of National Security Agency (NSA) documents drew Webb\u2019s attention, but also an escalation of harassment for speaking out in support of Snowden. It was at this point in 2013 that Webb decided to commit himself full time to exposing corruption.\n&gt;\n&gt; Webb\u2019s current investigation began with the July 2016 Wikileaks release of John Podesta\u2019s emails in which former Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman is fingered as the whistleblower and of whom, Podesta remarks in one of his emails that he was \u2018definitely for making an example of the suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it.\u2019 Knowing the scenario Braverman was likely to face as the source for a leak of such enormous consequence, Webb began digging deeper online into the former foundation CEO\u2019s story. Over the coming months, Webb began piecing together a vast global network of elected and appointed officials, Federal, State and local law enforcement, and powerful corporate interests that collude to strip nations of their resources exploiting taxpayer funds to do so. His research details a strategy and action plan used by this network to destabilize then undermine governments to serve the interests of those who profit most from ongoing war and devastation.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "George Webb is a scammer.

used crowd-sourcing and public-records requests to pursue stories; he has filed at least 18 public-records requests via MuckRock and appears in multiple MuckRock entries [1] [2]. His work is best known online for long-running, sometimes partisan investigations circulated via YouTube and other platforms, and for mobilizing amateur researchers in what some supporters call large \u201ccrowd-sourced\u201d investigations [3].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Limitations in available reporting and what is not found&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The provided sources are limited: MuckRock supplies documentation of his public-records activity but not comprehensive biographical background [2] [1]. The Medium profile is enthusiastic and frames Webb as leading large crowd-sourced probes, but independent verification, corroboration from legacy outlets, or detailed adjudication of specific claims are not present in these sources [3]. Available sources do not mention systematic fact-checks, corrections, or disputes about his major allegations (available sources do not mention those).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://caravantomidnight.com/george-webb/\"&gt;George Webb - caravantomidnight.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A career techie who happened to stumble across a drug operation run by local law enforcement about ten years ago, Webb attempted to report what he knew to the proper authorities, as any conscientious member of a community would. However, the unsuspecting Webb discovered that by doing so he became the target of systematic low-grade harassment and intimidation. A few years later when the FBI began setting up Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF) across the country under the auspices of current Deputy Attorney General Andrew McCabe, Webb\u2019s hometown became a nexus of controversy when it initially refused the agency. Months of protest ensued and a young Somalian man was named as the mastermind behind a bomb plot. The circumstances, however, seemed to unveil an unsuccessful jihadist recruitment psy-op by U.S. \u2018Intel,\u2019 based on historical evidence of such activity reported by journalists and retired law enforcement officers, such as the late FBI Director Ted Gunderson. This pattern also lined up directly with Webb\u2019s now-personal experience. In a final turn of events, Ed Snowden\u2019s groundbreaking leak of National Security Agency (NSA) documents drew Webb\u2019s attention, but also an escalation of harassment for speaking out in support of Snowden. It was at this point in 2013 that Webb decided to commit himself full time to exposing corruption.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Webb\u2019s current investigation began with the July 2016 Wikileaks release of John Podesta\u2019s emails in which former Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman is fingered as the whistleblower and of whom, Podesta remarks in one of his emails that he was \u2018definitely for making an example of the suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it.\u2019 Knowing the scenario Braverman was likely to face as the source for a leak of such enormous consequence, Webb began digging deeper online into the former foundation CEO\u2019s story. Over the coming months, Webb began piecing together a vast global network of elected and appointed officials, Federal, State and local law enforcement, and powerful corporate interests that collude to strip nations of their resources exploiting taxpayer funds to do so. His research details a strategy and action plan used by this network to destabilize then undermine governments to serve the interests of those who profit most from ongoing war and devastation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": true, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "rte_mode": "markdown", "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1pw26hn", "is_robot_indexable": false, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "milahu2", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/conspiracy/comments/1pw26hn/george_webb_is_a_scammer_since_when/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1pw26hn/george_webb_is_a_scammer_since_when/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2284532, "created_utc": 1766748533.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "1rt7h6uzha715b543bb978bc6c966bc0f57b7e2bc14ac00638", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4r", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "conspiracy", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "nw0d2ox", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "AutoModerator", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1766748535.0, "send_replies": false, "parent_id": "t3_1pw26hn", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "###[Meta] Sticky Comment\n\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does not apply*** when replying to this stickied comment.  \n\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does apply*** throughout the rest of this thread.\n\n*What this means*: Please keep any \"meta\" discussion directed at specific users, mods, or /r/conspiracy in general in this comment chain ***only.***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
