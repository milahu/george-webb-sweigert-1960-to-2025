i fear that the blog at https://georgewebb.substack.com/
has been taken over by the enemies of the original blog author = ID theft

soft evidence:

1. just a few days ago (around 2025-12-20), all posts have been hidden behind a paywall ("paid subscribers only" can access full posts and comments)
2. recent posts are just AI slop / AI hallucinations with broken source links
3. almost all comments are positive ("George Webb will save us"), despite the posts are trash

i fear that the new blog owners (CIA and friends...) are powerful enough to fake all telecommunications,
so you would have to meet George Webb in real life in person to actually verify the blog owner.
but probably this fails because you dont have the physical offline address of George Webb.

question:

since when are all posts hidden behind a paywall?
