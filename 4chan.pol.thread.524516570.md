# they killed George Webb Sweigert 1960 in december 2025

![](george-webb-paywall.avif.png)

1. his blog is hidden behind a paywall since about 2025-12-10.

2. his recent blog posts are AI slop / AI hallucinations. all sources are offline. the posts are filled with emotional images.

3. almost all comments are positive ("George Webb will save us"), despite the posts are trash.

4. he is censoring my comments on his blog posts, and he is ignoring my questions.

5. he published a hypothesis that the DuPont family killed Charlie Kirk because Charlie Kirk refused to cooperate to harvest data from his followers for DuPont's private secret service. he published this hypothesis in early december 2025. maybe this was the bit "too much truth" that got him killed? https://georgewebb.substack.com/p/charlie-kirk-and-the-dupont-billion + https://georgewebb.substack.com/p/all-roads-lead-to-wilmington-the

6. who has actual offline / direct / personal contact to George Webb?
